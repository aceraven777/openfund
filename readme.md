# openfund

OpenFund is a laravel based open source crowdfunding platform which is still in the early phases of development. We believe crowdfunding should be open source and localized where communities need it the most.

# Project satus
This project is currently still under development and should only be used by developers who would like to contribute to the project or use the base of what has already been implemented.

# Support us

We will be doing a round of crowdfunding to speed up development in the future. To get notified about our crowdfunding campaign or for general updates click here https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/openfund/coming_soon/.

# Contributing to OpenFund

Any contributions are welcome and reviewed before merging into the main repository. You can clone the project and begin developing right away. Right now we are trying to clone the main features of KickStarter so if you're unsure where to begin have a look there and see what's worth implementing next.

# About the team

We are a small team of developers working in our spare time to get this project off the ground. We are currently employed as developers at a development company based in Cape Town, South Africa.

# Release date 25th October 2016

We are planning on having a working implementation ready for the public on the 25th of August 2016. This release should include all the basic functionality needed to run a crowdfunding website.
